   I.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  I always wanted to meditate more, but never really got around to it. And (I thought) I had an unimpeachable excuse. The demands of a medical career are incompatible with such a time-consuming practice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Enter Daniel Ingram MD, an emergency physician who claims to have achieved enlightenment just after graduating medical school. His book is called
  <i>
   <a href="http://integrateddaniel.info/book/">
    Mastering The Core Teachings Of The Buddha
   </a>
  </i>
  , but he could also have called it
  <i>
   Buddhism For ER Docs
  </i>
  . ER docs are famous for being practical, working fast, and thinking everyone else is an idiot. MCTB delivers on all three counts. And if you&rsquo;ve ever had an attending quiz you on the difference between type 1 and type 2 second-degree heart block, you&rsquo;ll love Ingram&rsquo;s taxonomy of the stages of enlightenment.
 </p>
 <p>
  The result is a sort of perfect antidote to the vague hippie-ism you get from a lot of spirituality. For example, from page 324:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I feel the need to address, which is to say shoot down with every bit of rhetorical force I have, the notion promoted by some teachers and even traditions that there is nothing to do, nothing to accomplish, no goal to obtain, no enlightenment other than the ordinary state of being&hellip;which, if it were true, would have been very nice of them, except that it is complete bullshit. The Nothing To Do School and the You Are Already There School are both basically vile extremes on the same basic notion that all effort to attain to mastery is already missing the point, an error of craving and grasping. They both contradict the fundamental premise of this book, namely that there is something amazing to attain and understand and that there are specific, reproducible methods that can help you do that. Here is a detailed analysis of what is wrong with these and related perspectives&hellip;
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  &hellip;followed by a detailed analysis of what&rsquo;s wrong with this position, which he compared to &ldquo;let[ting] a blind and partially paralyzed untrained stroke victim perform open-heart surgery on your child based on the notion that they are already an accomplished surgeon but just have to realize it&rdquo;.
 </p>
 <p>
  This isn&rsquo;t to say that MCTB isn&rsquo;t a spiritual book, or that it shies away from mysticism or the transcendent. MCTB is very happy to discuss mysticism and the transcendent. It just quarantines the mystery within a carefully explained structure of rationally-arranged progress, so that it looks something like &ldquo;and at square 41B in our perfectly rectangular grid you&rsquo;ll encounter a mind-state which is impossible to explain even in principle, here are a few woefully inadequate metaphors for this mind-state so you&rsquo;ll know when you&rsquo;ve found it and should move on to square 41C.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a little jarring. But &ndash; Ingram argues &ndash; it&rsquo;s also very Buddhist. If you read the sutras with an open mind, the Buddha sounds a lot more like an ER doctor than a hippie. MCTB has a very Protestant fundamentalist feeling of digging through the exterior trappings of a religion to try to return to the purity of its origins. As far as I can tell, it succeeds &ndash; and in succeeding helped me understand Buddhism a whole lot better than anything else I&rsquo;ve read.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   II.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Ingram follows the Buddha in dividing the essence of Buddhism into three teachings: morality, concentration, and wisdom.
 </p>
 <p>
  Morality seems like the odd one out here. Some Buddhists like to insist that Buddhism isn&rsquo;t really a &ldquo;religion&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s less like Christianity or Islam than it is like (for example) high intensity training at the gym &ndash; a highly regimented form of practice that improves certain faculties if pursued correctly. Talking about &ldquo;morality&rdquo; makes this sound kind of hollow; nobody says you have to be a good person to get bigger muscles from lifting weights.
 </p>
 <p>
  MCTB gives the traditional answer: you should be moral because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do,
  <i>
   but also
  </i>
  because it helps meditation. The same things that make you able to sleep at night with a clear mind make you able to meditate with a clear mind:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   One more great thing about the first training [morality] is that it really helps with the next training: concentration. So here&rsquo;s a tip: if you are finding it hard to concentrate because your mind is filled with guilt, judgment, envy or some other hard and difficult thought pattern, also work on the first training, kindness. It will be time well spent.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  That leaves concentration (samatha) and wisdom (vipassana). You do samatha to get a powerful mind; you get a powerful mind in order do to vipassana.
 </p>
 <p>
  Samatha meditation is the &ldquo;mindfulness&rdquo; stuff you&rsquo;re always hearing about: concentrate on the breath, don&rsquo;t let yourself get distracted, see if you can just attend to the breath and nothing else for minutes or hours. I read whole books about this before without understanding
  <i>
   why
  </i>
  it was supposed to be good, aside from vague things like &ldquo;makes you feel more serene&rdquo;. MCTB gives two reasons: first, it gets you into jhanas. Second, it prepares you for vipassana.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jhanas are unusual mental states you can get into with enough concentration. Some of them are super blissful. Others are super tranquil. They&rsquo;re not particularly meaningful in and of themselves, but they can give you heroin-level euphoria without having to worry about sticking needles in your veins. MCTB says, understatedly, that they can be a good encouragement to continue your meditation practice. It gives a taxonomy of eight jhanas, and suggests that a few months of training in samatha meditation can get you to the point where you can reach at least the first.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the main point of samatha meditation is to improve your concentration ability so you can direct it to ordinary experience. Become so good at concentrating that you can attain various jhanas &ndash; but then, instead of focusing on infinite bliss or whatever other cool things you can do with your new talent, look at a wall or listen to the breeze or just try to understand the experience of existing in time.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is vipassana (&ldquo;insight&rdquo;, &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo;) meditation. It&rsquo;s a deep focus on the tiniest details of your mental experience, details so fleeting and subtle that without a samatha-trained mind you&rsquo;ll miss them entirely. One such detail is the infamous &ldquo;vibrations&rdquo;, so beloved of hippies. Ingram notes that every sensation vibrates in and out of consciousness at a rate of between five and forty vibrations per second, sometimes speeding up or slowing down depending on your mental state. I&rsquo;m a pathetic meditator and about as far from enlightenment as anybody in this world, but with enough focus even I have been able to confirm this to be true. And this is pretty close to the frequency of brain waves, which seems like a pretty interesting coincidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this is just an example. The point is that if you really,
  <i>
   really
  </i>
  examine your phenomenological experience, you realize all sorts of surprising things. Ingram says that one early insight is a perception of your mental awareness of a phenomenon as separate from your perception of that phenomenon:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This mental impression of a previous sensation is like an echo, a resonance. The mind takes a crude impression of the object, and that is what we can think about, remember, and process. Then there may be a thought or an image that arises and passes, and then, if the mind is stable, another physical pulse. Each one of these arises and vanishes completely before the other begins, so it is extremely possible to sort out which is which with a stable mind dedicated to consistent precision and not being lost in stories. This means the instant you have experienced something, you know that it isn&rsquo;t there any more, and whatever is there is a new sensation that will be gone in an instant. There are typically many other impermanent sensations and impressions interspersed with these, but, for the sake of practice, this is close enough to what is happening to be a good working model.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engage with the preceding paragraphs. They are the stuff upon which great insight practice is based. Given that you know sensations are vibrating, pulsing in and out of reality, and that, for the sake of practice, every sensation is followed directly by a mental impression, you now know exactly what you are looking for. You have a clear standard. If you are not experiencing it, then stabilize the mind further, and be clearer about exactly when and where there are physical sensations.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  With enough of this work, you gain direct insight into what Buddhists call &ldquo;the three characteristics&rdquo;. The first is impermanence, and is related to all the stuff above about how sensations flicker and disappear. The second is called &ldquo;unsatisfactoriness&rdquo;, and involves the inability of any sensation to be fulfilling in some fundamental way. And the last is &ldquo;no-self&rdquo;, an awareness that these sensations don&rsquo;t really cohere into the classic image of a single unified person thinking and perceiving them.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Buddha famously said that &ldquo;life is suffering&rdquo;, and placed the idea of suffering &ndash;
  <i>
   dukkha
  </i>
  &ndash; as the center of his system. This
  <i>
   dukkha
  </i>
  is the same as the &ldquo;unsatisfactoriness&rdquo; above.
 </p>
 <p>
  I always figured the Buddha was talking about life being suffering in the sense that sometimes you&rsquo;re poor, or you&rsquo;re sick, or you have a bad day. And I always figured that making money or exercising or working to make your day better sounded like a more promising route to dealing with this kind of suffering than any kind of meditative practice. Ingram doesn&rsquo;t
  <i>
   disagree
  </i>
  that things like bad days are examples of
  <i>
   dukkha
  </i>
  . But he explains that this is something way more fundamental. Even if you were having the best day of your life and everything was going perfectly, if you slowed your mind down and concentrated perfectly on any specific atomic sensation, that sensation would include
  <i>
   dukkha
  </i>
  .
  <i>
   Dukkha
  </i>
  is part of the mental machinery.
 </p>
 <p>
  MCTB acknowledges that all of this sounds really weird. And there are more depths of insight meditation, all sorts of weird things you notice when you look deep enough, that are even weirder. It tries to be very clear that nothing it&rsquo;s writing about is going to make much sense in words, and that reading the words doesn&rsquo;t really tell you very much. The only way to really make sense of it is to practice meditation.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you understand all of this on a really fundamental level &ndash; when you&rsquo;re able to tease apart every sensation and subsensation and subsubsensation and see its individual components laid out before you &ndash; then at some point your normal model of the world starts running into contradictions and losing its explanatory power. This is very unpleasant, and eventually your mind does some sort of awkward Moebius twist on itself, adopts a better model of the world, and becomes enlightened.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   III.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  The rest of the book is dedicated to laying out, in detail, all the steps that you have to go through before this happens. In Ingram&rsquo;s model &ndash; based on but not identical to the various models in various Buddhist traditions &ndash; there are fifteen steps you have to go through before &ldquo;stream entry&rdquo; &ndash; the first level of enlightenment. You start off at the first step, after meditating some number of weeks or months or years you pass to the second step, and so on.
 </p>
 <p>
  A lot of these are pretty boring, but Ingram focuses on the fourth step, Arising And Passing Away. Meditators in this step enter what sounds like a hypomanic episode:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In the early part of this stage, the meditator&rsquo;s mind speeds up more and more quickly, and reality begins to be perceived as particles or fine vibrations of mind and matter, each arising and vanishing utterly at tremendous speed&hellip;As this stage deepens and matures, meditators let go of even the high levels of clarity and the other strong factors of meditation, perceive even these to arise and pass as just vibrations, not satisfy, and not be self. They may plunge down into the very depths of the mind as though plunging deep underwater to where they can perceive individual frames of reality arise and pass with breathtaking clarity as though in slow motion [&hellip;]
  </p>
  <p>
   Strong sensual or sexual feelings and dreams are common at this stage, and these may have a non-discriminating quality that those attached to their notion of themselves as being something other than partially bisexual may find disturbing. Further, if you have unresolved issues around sexuality, which we basically all have, you may encounter aspects of them during this stage. This stage, its afterglow, and the almost withdrawal-like crash that can follow seem to increase the temptation to indulge in all manner of hedonistic delights, particularly substances and sex. As the bliss wears off, we may find ourselves feeling very hungry or lustful, craving chocolate, wanting to go out and party, or something like that. If we have addictions that we have been fighting, some extra vigilance near the end of this stage might be helpful.
  </p>
  <p>
   This stage also tends to give people more of an extroverted, zealous or visionary quality, and they may have all sorts of energy to pour into somewhat idealistic or grand projects and schemes. At the far extreme of what can happen, this stage can imbue one with the powerful charisma of the radical religious leader.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, at nearly the peak of the possible resolution of the mind, they cross something called &ldquo;The Arising and Passing Event&rdquo; (A&amp;P Event) or &ldquo;Deep Insight into the Arising and Passing Away&rdquo;&hellip;Those who have crossed the A&amp;P Event have stood on the ragged edge of reality and the mind for just an instant, and they know that awakening is possible. They will have great faith, may want to tell everyone to practice, and are generally evangelical for a while. They will have an increased ability to understand the teachings due to their direct and non-conceptual experience of the Three Characteristics. Philosophy that deals with the fundamental paradoxes of duality will be less problematic for them in some way, and they may find this fascinating for a time. Those with a strong philosophical bent will find that they can now philosophize rings around those who have not attained to this stage of insight. They may also incorrectly think that they are enlightened, as what they have seen was completely spectacular and profound. In fact, this is strangely common for some period of time, and thus may stop practicing when they have actually only really begun.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is a common time for people to write inspired dharma books, poetry, spiritual songs, and that sort of thing. This is also the stage when people are more likely to join monasteries or go on great spiritual quests. It is also worth noting that this stage can look an awful lot like a manic episode as defined in the DSM-IV (the current diagnostic manual of psychiatry). The rapture and intensity of this stage can be basically off the scale, the absolute peak on the path of insight, but it doesn&rsquo;t last. Soon the meditator will learn what is meant by the phrase, &ldquo;Better not to begin. Once begun, better to finish!&rdquo;
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  If this last part sounds ominous, it probably should. If the fourth stage looks like a manic episode, the next five or six stages all look like some flavor of deep clinical depression. Ingram discusses several spiritual traditions and finds that they all warn of an uncanny valley halfway along the spiritual path; he himself adopts St. John&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;Dark Night Of The Soul&rdquo;. Once you have meditated enough to reach the A&amp;P Event, you&rsquo;re stuck in the (very unpleasant) Dark Night Of The Soul until you can meditate your way out of it, which could take months or years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ingram&rsquo;s theory is that many people have had spiritual experiences without deliberately pursuing a spiritual practice &ndash; whether this be from everyday life, or prayer, or drugs, or even things you do in dreams. Some of these people
  <i>
   accidentally
  </i>
  cross the A&amp;P Event, reach the Dark Night Of The Soul, and &ndash; not even knowing that the way out is through meditation &ndash; get stuck there for years, having nothing but a vague spiritual yearning and sense that something&rsquo;s not right. He says that this is his own origin story &ndash; he got stuck in the Dark Night after having an A&amp;P Event in a dream at age 15, was low-grade depressed for most of his life, and only recovered once he studied enough Buddhism to realize what had happened to him and how he could meditate his way out:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   When I was about 15 years old I accidentally ran into some of the classic early meditation experiences described in the ancient texts and my reluctant spiritual quest began. I did not realize what had happened, nor did I realize that I had crossed something like a point of no return, something I would later call the Arising and Passing Away. I knew that I had had a very strange dream with bright lights, that my entire body and world had seemed to explode like fireworks, and that afterwards I somehow had to find something, but I had no idea what that was. I philosophized frantically for years until I finally began to realize that no amount of thinking was going to solve my deeper spiritual issues and complete the cycle of practice that had already started.
  </p>
  <p>
   I had a very good friend that was in the band that employed me as a sound tech and roadie. He was in a similar place, caught like me in something we would later call the Dark Night and other names. He also realized that logic and cognitive restructuring were not going to help us in the end. We looked carefully at what other philosophers had done when they came to the same point, and noted that some of our favorites had turned to mystical practices. We reasoned that some sort of nondual wisdom that came from direct experience was the only way to go, but acquiring that sort of wisdom seemed a daunting task if not
   <br/>
   impossible [&hellip;]
  </p>
  <p>
   I [finally] came to the profound realization that they have actually worked all of this stuff out. Those darn Buddhists have come up with very simple techniques that lead directly to remarkable results if you follow instructions and get the dose high enough. While some people don&rsquo;t like this sort of cookbook approach to meditation, I am so grateful for their recipes that words fail to express my profound gratitude for the successes they have afforded me. Their simple and ancient practices revealed more and more of what I sought. I found my experiences filling in the gaps in the texts and teachings, debunking the myths that pervade the standard Buddhist dogma and revealing the secrets meditation teachers routinely keep to themselves. Finally, I came to a place where I felt comfortable writing the book that I had been looking for, the book you now hold in your hands.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Once you meditate your way out of the Dark Night, you go through some more harrowing experiences, until you finally reach the fifteenth stage, Fruiition, and achieve &ldquo;stream entry&rdquo; &ndash; the first level of enlightenment. Then you do it all again on a higher level, kind of like those video games where when you beat the game you get access to New Game+ . Traditionally it takes four repetitions of the spiritual path before you attain complete perfect enlightenment, but Ingram suggests this is metaphorical and says it took him approximately twenty-seven repetitions over seven years.
 </p>
 <p>
  He also says &ndash; and here his usual lucidity deserted him and I ended up kind of confused &ndash; that once you&rsquo;ve achieved stream entry, you&rsquo;re going to be going down paths whether you like it or not &ndash; the &ldquo;stream&rdquo; metaphor is apt insofar as it suggests being borne along by a current. The rest of your life &ndash; even after you achieve complete perfect enlightenment &ndash; will be spent cycling through the fifteen stages, with each stage lasting a few days to months.
 </p>
 <p>
  This seems pretty bad, since the stages look a lot like depression, mania, and other more arcane psychiatric and psychological problems. Even if you don&rsquo;t mind the emotional roller coaster, a lot of them sound just plain
  <i>
   exhausting
  </i>
  , with your modes of cognition and perception shifting and coming into question at various points. MCTB offers some tips for dealing with this &ndash; you can always slow your progress down the path by gorging on food, refusing to meditate, and doing various other unspiritual things, but the whole thing lampshades a question that MCTB profoundly fails at giving anything remotely like an answer to:
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   IV.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  <i>
   Why would you want to do any of this?
  </i>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Buddha is supposed to have said: &ldquo;I gained nothing whatsoever from Supreme Enlightenment, and for that reason it is called Supreme Enlightenment&rdquo;. And sure, that&rsquo;s the enigmatic Zen-sounding sort of statement we expect from our spiritual leaders. But if Buddhist practice is really difficult, and makes you perceive every single sensation as profoundly unsatisfactory in some hard-to-define way, and can plunge you into a neverending depression which you
  <i>
   might
  </i>
  get out of if you meditate hard enough, and then gives you a sort of permanent annoying low-grade bipolar disorder
  <i>
   even if you succeed
  </i>
  , then we&rsquo;re going to need something better than pithy quotes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ingram dedicates himself
  <i>
   hard
  </i>
  to debunking a lot of the things people would use to fill the gap. Pages 261-328 discuss the various claims Buddhist schools have made about enlightenment, mostly to deny them all. He has nothing but contempt for the obviously silly ones, like how enlightened people can fly around and zap you with their third eyes. But he&rsquo;s equally dismissive of things that sort of seem like the basics. He denies claims about how enlightened people can&rsquo;t get angry, or effortlessly resist temptation, or feel universal unconditional love, or things like that. Some of this he supports with stories of enlightened leaders
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%B6gyam_Trungpa#Controversies">
   behaving badly
  </a>
  ; other times he cites himself as an enlightened person who frequently experiences anger, pain, and the like. Once he&rsquo;s stripped everything else away, he says the only thing one can say about enlightenment is that it grants a powerful true experience of the non-dual nature of the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  But still,
  <i>
   why would we want to get that
  </i>
  ? I am super in favor of knowledge-for-knowledge&rsquo;s-sake, but I&rsquo;ve also read enough Lovecraft to have strong opinions about poking around Ultimate Reality in ways that tend to destroy your mental health.
 </p>
 <p>
  The best Ingram can do is this:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I realize that I am not doing a good job of advertising enlightenment here, particularly following my descriptions of the Dark Night. Good point. My thesis is that those who must find it will, regardless of how it is advertised. As to the rest, well, what can be said? Am I doing a disservice by not selling it like nearly everyone else does? I don&rsquo;t think so. If you want grand advertisements for enlightenment, there is a great stinking mountain of it there for you partake of, so I hardly think that my bringing it down to earth is going to cause some harmful deficiency of glitz in the great spiritual marketplace.
  </p>
  <p>
   [Meditation teacher] Bill Hamilton had a lot of great one-liners, but my favorite concerned insight practices and their fruits, of which he said, &ldquo;Highly recommended, can&rsquo;t tell you why.&rdquo; That is probably the safest and most accurate advertisement for enlightenment that I have ever heard.
  </p>

  I was reading MCTB at the same time I read
  <i>
   <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/">
    Surfing Uncertainty
   </a>
  </i>
  , and it was hard not to compare them. Both claim to be guides to the mysteries of the mind &ndash; one from an external scientific perspective, the other from an internal phenomenological perspective. Is there any way to link them up?
 </p>
 <p>
  Remember this quote from
  <i>
   Surfing Uncertainty
  </i>
  ?:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Plausibly, it is only because the world we encounter must be parsed for action and intervention that we encounter, in experience, a relatively unambiguous determinate world at all. Subtract the need for action and the broadly Bayesian framework can seem quite at odds with the phenomenal facts about conscious perceptual experience: our world, it might be said, does not look as if it is encoded in an intertwined set of probability density distributions. Instead, it looks unitary and, on a clear day, unambiguous&hellip;biological systems, as mentioned earlier, may be informed by a variety of learned or innate &ldquo;hyperpriors&rdquo; concerning the general nature of the world. One such hyperprior might be that the world is usually in one determinate state or another.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Taken seriously, it suggests that some of the most fundamental factors of our experience are not real features of the sensory world, but very strong assumptions to which we fit sense-data in order to make sense of them. And Ingram&rsquo;s theory of vipassana meditation looks a lot like concentrating really hard on our actual sense-data to try to disentangle them from the assumptions that make them cohere.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the same way that our priors &ldquo;snap&rdquo; phrases like &ldquo;PARIS IN THE THE SPRINGTIME&rdquo; to a more coherent picture with only one &ldquo;the&rdquo;, or &ldquo;snap&rdquo; our saccade-jolted and blind-spot-filled visual world into a reasonable image, maybe they snap all of this vibrating and arising and passing away into something that looks like a permanent stable image of the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in the same way that concentrating on &ldquo;PARIS IN THE THE SPRINGTIME&rdquo; really hard without any preconceptions lets you sniff out the extra &ldquo;the&rdquo;, so maybe enough samatha meditation lets you concentrate on the permanent stable image of the world until it dissolves into whatever the brain is actually doing. Maybe with enough dedication to observing reality as it really is rather than as you predict it to be, you can expose even the subjective experience of an observer as just a really strong hyperprior on all of the thought-and-emotion-related sense-data you&rsquo;re getting.
 </p>
 <p>
  That leaves
  <i>
   dukkha
  </i>
  , this weird unsatisfactoriness that supposedly inheres in every sensation individually as well as life in general. If the goal of the brain is minimizing prediction error, if all of our normal forms of suffering like hunger and thirst and pain are just special cases of predictive error in certain inherent drives, then &ndash; well, this is a very fundamental form of badness which is inherent in all sensation and perception, and which a sufficiently-concentrated phenomenologist might be able to notice directly. Relevant? I&rsquo;m not sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <i>
   Mastering The Core Teachings Of The Buddha

<h1>Meditative States As Feedback Loops</h1>

  Three years ago, in

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   If the brain had been designed by an amateur, it would enter a runaway feedback loop the first time it felt an emotion. Think about it. You see a butterfly. This makes you happy. Being happy is an unexpected pleasant surprise. Now you&rsquo;re happy that you&rsquo;re happy. This makes you extra happy. Being extra happy is awesome! This makes you extra extra happy. And so on to as much bliss as your neurons are capable of representing.  In the real world, either those feedback loops usually don&rsquo;t happen, or they converge and stop at some finite point. I would not be surprised to learn that a lot of evolutionary innovation and biochemical complexity goes into creating a strong barrier against conditioning on your own internal experience.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Evolutionary innovation and biochemical complexity&rdquo;? Haha no, people are just too distractable to keep having the same emotion for more than a couple seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  I get this from Leigh Brasington&rsquo;s excellent
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Right-Concentration-Practical-Guide-Jhanas-ebook/dp/B017JJOXQ6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1505098556&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Right+Concentration&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=slatestarcode-20&amp;linkId=e7d22ca0de149894ff1d74a641d65a30">
   <i>
    Right Concentration
   </i>
  </a>
  , a Buddhist perspective on various advanced meditative states called
  <i>
   jhanas
  </i>
  . To get to the first of these jhanas (there are eight in all), you become really good at concentration meditation, until you can concentrate on your breath a long time without getting distracted. Then you concentrate on your breath for a long time. Then you take your one-pointed ultra-concentrated mind, and you notice (or generate, or imagine) a pleasant feeling. This produces the first jhana, which the Buddhist scriptures describe as:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   One drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses one&rsquo;s body with the rapture and happiness born of seclusion, so that there is no part of one&rsquo;s body that is not suffused by rapture and happiness.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Brasington backs this up with his own experience and those of other meditators he knows. The first jhana is really, really,
  <i>
   really
  </i>
  pleasurable; when you hear meditators talk about achieving &ldquo;bliss states&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s probably something like the first jhana.
 </p>
 <p>
  And here&rsquo;s the book&rsquo;s description of why it happens:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   When access concentration is firmly established, then you shift your attention from the breath (or whatever your meditation object is) to a pleasant sensation. You put your attention on that sensation, and maintain your attention on that sensation, and do nothing else&hellip;
  </p>
  <p>
   What you are attempting to do is set up a positive feedback loop. An example of a positive feedback loop is that awful noise a speaker will make if a microphone is held too close to it. What&rsquo;s happening is that the ambient noise in the room goes into the microphone, is amplified by the amplifier, and comes out the speaker louder. It then reenters the microphone, gets amplified even more, comes out louder still, goes into the microphone yet again, and so on. You are trying to do exactly the same thing, except, rather than a positive feedback loop of noise, you are attempting to generate a positive feedback loop of pleasure. You hold your attention on a pleasant sensation. That feels nice, adding a bit more pleasure to your overall experience. That addition is also pleasurable, adding more pleasure, and so on, until, instead of getting a horrible noise, you get an explosion of pleasure.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The book doesn&rsquo;t come out and say that the other seven jhanas are the same thing, but that seems consistent with the descriptions. For example, the fourth jhana is a state of ultimate calm. Seems like maybe if you become calm, then being so calm is kind of calming, and that&rsquo;s even more calming, and so on until you&rsquo;ve maxed out your mental calmness-meter.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the explanation of why this doesn&rsquo;t happen all the time is that non-meditators just can&rsquo;t concentrate hard enough. A microphone-amp system that turns on and off a couple of times each second will never get a really good feedback loop going. A mind that&rsquo;s always flitting from one thing to another can&rsquo;t build up enough
  <i>
   self-referentiality
  </i>
  to reach infinite bliss.

  I write a lot about the importance of IQ research, and I try to debunk pseudoscientific claims that IQ &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t real&rdquo; or &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t matter&rdquo; or &ldquo;just shows how well you do on a test&rdquo;. IQ is one of the best-studied ideas in psychology, one of our best predictors of job performance, future income, and various other forms of success, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  But every so often, I get comments/emails saying something like &ldquo;Help! I just took an IQ test and learned that my IQ is x! This is much lower than I thought, and so obviously I will be a failure in everything I do in life. Can you direct me to the best cliff to jump off of?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  So I want to clarify: IQ is very useful and powerful
  <i>
   for research purposes
  </i>
  . It&rsquo;s not nearly as interesting
  <i>
   for you personally
  </i>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  How can this be?
 </p>
 <p>
  Consider something like income inequality: kids from rich families are at an advantage in life; kids from poor families are at a disadvantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  From a
  <i>
   research
  </i>
  point of view, it&rsquo;s really important to understand this is true. A scientific establishment in denial that having wealthy parents gave you a leg up in life would be an intellectual disgrace. Knowing that wealth runs in families is vital for even a minimal understanding of society, and anybody forced to deny that for political reasons would end up so hopelessly confused that they might as well just give up on having a coherent world-view.
 </p>
 <p>
  From an
  <i>
   personal
  </i>
  point of view, coming from a poor family probably isn&rsquo;t great
  <i>
   but shouldn&rsquo;t be infinitely discouraging

  . It doesn&rsquo;t suggest that some kid should think to herself &ldquo;I come from a family that only makes $30,000 per year, guess that means I&rsquo;m doomed to be a failure forever, might as well not even try&rdquo;. A poor kid is certainly at a disadvantage relative to a rich kid, but probably she knew that already long before any scientist came around to tell her. If she took the scientific study of intergenerational income transmission as something more official and final than her general sense that life was hard &ndash; if she obsessively recorded every raise and bonus her parents got on the grounds that it determined her own hope for the future &ndash; she would be giving the science more weight than it deserves.

  So to the people who write me heartfelt letters complaining about their low IQs, I want to make two important points. First, we&rsquo;re not that good at measuring individual IQs. Second, individual IQs aren&rsquo;t that good at predicting things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>

 </p>
 <p>
  Start with the measurement problems. People who complain about low IQs (not to mention people who boast about high IQs) are often wildly off about the number.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the official studies, IQ tests are rarely wrong. The standard error of measurement is somewhere between 3-7 points (
  <a href="http://www.iapsych.com/iapap101/iapap1015.pdf">
   1
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/7044/2/WhitakerError.pdf">

  ,
  <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=IUElDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=SEM+IQ&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4nrHkNOJ6e&amp;sig=hYky4WaBaifAxBhCYGpP0Mf6iGE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ1Ynvhb3WAhXqy1QKHXFRCM0Q6AEITDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=SEM%20IQ&amp;f=false">
   3
  </a>
  ). Call it 5, and that means your tested IQ will only be off by 5+ points 32% of the time. It&rsquo;ll only be off by 10+ points 5% of the time, and really big errors should be near impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  In reality, I constantly hear about people getting IQ scores that don&rsquo;t make any sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here&rsquo;s a pretty standard entry in the &ldquo;help my IQ is so low&rdquo; genre &ndash;
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/70lkn5/grappling_with_the_reality_of_having_a/">
   Grappling With The Reality Of Having A Below Average IQ
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   When I was 16, as a part of an educational assessment, I took both the WAIS-IV and Woodcock Johnson Cognitive Batteries. My mother was curious as to why I struggled in certain subjects throughout my educational career, particularly in mathematical areas like geometry.
  </p>
  <p>
   I never got a chance to have a discussion with the psychologist about the results, so I was left to interpret them with me, myself, and the big I known as the Internet &ndash; a dangerous activity, I know. This meant two years to date of armchair research, and subsequently, an incessant fear of the implications of my below-average IQ, which stands at a pitiful 94&hellip;I still struggle in certain areas of comprehension. I received a score of 1070 on the SAT, (540 Reading &amp; 530 Math), and am barely scraping by in my college algebra class. Honestly, I would be ashamed if any of my coworkers knew I barely could do high school-level algebra.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This person thinks they&rsquo;re reinforcing their point by listing two different tests, but actually a 1070 on the SAT corresponds to about 104, a full ten points higher. Based on other things in their post &ndash; their correct use of big words and complicated sentence structure, their mention that they work a successful job in cybersecurity, the fact that they read a philosophy/psychology subreddit for fun &ndash; I&rsquo;m guessing the 104 is closer to the truth.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the comments on the same Reddit thread:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Interesting, I hope more people who have an avg. or low IQ post. Personally I had an IQ of 90 or so, but the day of the test I stayed up almost the entire night, slept maybe two hours and as a naive caffeine user I had around 500 mg caffeine. Maybe low IQ people do that.
  </p>
  <p>
   I did IQTest.dk Raven&rsquo;s test on impulse after seeing a video of Peterson&rsquo;s regarding the importance of IQ, not in a very focused mode, almost ADHD like with rumination and I scored 108, but many claim low scores by around 0.5-1 SD, so that would put me in 115-123. I also am vegan, so creatine might increase my IQ by a few points. I think I am in the 120&rsquo;s, but low IQ people tend to overestimate their IQ, but at least I am certainly 108 non-verbally, which is pretty average and low.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The commenter is right that IQtest.dk usually underestimates scores compared to other tests. But even if we take it at face value, his first score was almost twenty points off. By the official numbers, that should only happen once in every 15,000 people. In reality, someone posts a thread about it on Reddit and another person immediately shows up to say &ldquo;Yeah, that happened to me&rdquo;.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nobel-winning physicist Richard Feynman famously scored &ldquo;only&rdquo; 124 on an IQ test in school &ndash; still bright, but nowhere near what you would expect of a Nobelist. Some people
  <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/finding-the-next-einstein/201112/polymath-physicist-richard-feynmans-low-iq-and-finding-another">
   point out
  </a>
  that it might have been biased towards measuring verbal rather than math abilities &ndash; then again, Feynman&rsquo;s autobiography (admittedly edited and stitched together by a ghostwriter) sold 500,000 copies and made the New York Times bestseller list. So either his tested IQ was off by at least 30 points (supposed chance of this happening: 1/505 million), or IQ isn&rsquo;t real and all of the studies showing that it is are made up by lizardmen to confuse us. In either case, you should be less concerned if your own school IQ tests seem kind of low.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don&rsquo;t know why there&rsquo;s such a discrepancy between the official reliability numbers and the ones that anecdotally make sense. My guess is that the official studies give the tests better somehow. They use professional test administrators instead of overworked school counselors. They give them at a specific time of day instead of while the testee is half-asleep. They don&rsquo;t let people take a bunch of caffeine before the test. They actually write the result down in a spreadsheet they have right there instead of trusting the testee to remember it accurately.
 </p>
 <p>
  In my own field, official studies diagnose psychiatric diseases through beautiful Structured Clinical Interviews performed to exacting guidelines. Then real doctors diagnose them
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/29/my-irb-nightmare/">
   through checklists that say &ldquo;DO NOT USE FOR DIAGNOSIS&rdquo;
  </a>
  in big letters on the top. If psychometrics is at all similar, the clashing numbers aren&rsquo;t much of a mystery.
 </p>
 <p>
  But two other points that might also be involved.
 </p>
 <p>
  First,
  <i>
   on a population level
  </i>
  IQ is very stable with age. Over a study of 87,498 Scottish children, age 11 IQ and adult IQ
  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-barry-kaufman/intelligence-is-still-not_b_1078112.html">
   correlated at 0.66
  </a>
  , about as strong and impressive a correlation as you&rsquo;ll ever find in the social sciences. But &ldquo;correlation of 0.66&rdquo; is also known as &ldquo;only predicts 44% of the variance&rdquo;.
  <i>
   On an individual level
  </i>
  , it is totally possible and not even that surprising to have an IQ of 100 at age 11 but 120 at age 30, or vice versa. Any IQ score you got before high school should be considered a
  <i>
   plausible prediction
  </i>
  about your adult IQ and nothing more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Second, the people who get low IQ scores, are shocked, find their whole world tumbling in on themselves, and desperately try to hold on to their dream of being an intellectual &ndash; are not a representative sample of the people who get low IQ scores. The average person who gets a low IQ score says &ldquo;Yup, guess that would explain why I&rsquo;m failing all my classes&rdquo;, and then goes back to beating up nerds. When you see someone saying &ldquo;Help, I got a low IQ score, I&rsquo;ve double-checked the standard deviation of all of my subscores and found some slight discrepancy but I&rsquo;m not sure if that counts as Bayesian evidence that the global value is erroneous&rdquo;, then, well &ndash; look, I wouldn&rsquo;t be making fun of these people if I didn&rsquo;t
  <i>
   constantly come across them
  </i>
  . You know who you are.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just for fun, I analyzed the lowest IQ scores in my collection of SSC/LW surveys. I was only able to find three people who claimed to have an IQ &le; 100 plus gave SAT results. All three had SAT scores corresponding to IQs in the 120s.
 </p>
 <p>
  I conclude that at least among the kind of people I encounter and who tend to send me these emails, IQ estimates are pretty terrible.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is absolutely consistent with population averages of thousands of IQ estimates still being valuable and useful research tools. It just means you shouldn&rsquo;t use it
  <i>
   on yourself
  </i>
  . Statistics is what tells us that almost everybody feels stimulated on amphetamines. Reality is my patient who consistently goes to sleep every time she takes Adderall. Neither the statistics nor the lived experience are wrong &ndash; but if you use one when you need the other, you&rsquo;re going to have a bad time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   III.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  The second problem is that even if you avoid the problems mentioned above and measure IQ 100% correctly,
  <i>
   it&rsquo;s just not that usefully predictive
  </i>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Isn&rsquo;t that heresy?! Isn&rsquo;t IQ the most predictive thing we have? Doesn&rsquo;t it affect every life outcome as proven again and again in well-replicated experiments?
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes! I&rsquo;m not denying any of that. I&rsquo;m saying that
  <i>
   things that are statistically true aren&rsquo;t always true for any individual
  </i>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again, consider the analogy to family transmission of income. Your parents&rsquo; socioeconomic status correlates with your own at about r = 0.2 to 0.3, depending on how you define &ldquo;socioeconomic status&rdquo;. By coincidence, this is pretty much the same correlation that
  <a href="http://www.emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/Intelligence-and-socioeconomic-success-A-meta-analytic-review-of-longitudinal-research.pdf">
   Strenze (2006)
  </a>
  found for IQ and socioeconomic status. Everyone knows that having rich parents is pretty useful if you want to succeed. But everyone also knows that rich parents aren&rsquo;t the only thing that goes into success. Someone from a poor family who tries really hard and gets a lot of other advantages still has a chance to make it. A sociologist or economist should be very interested in parent-child success correlations; the average person trying to get ahead should just shrug, realize things are going to be a little easier/harder than they would have been otherwise, and get on with their life.
 </p>
 <p>
  And this isn&rsquo;t just about gaining success by becoming an athlete or musician or some other less-intellectual pursuit. Chess talent is correlated with IQ
  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307874653_The_relationship_between_cognitive_ability_and_chess_skill_A_comprehensive_meta-analysis">
   at 0.24
  </a>
  , about the same as income. IQ is some complicated central phenomenon that contributes a little to every cognitive skill, but it doesn&rsquo;t entirely determine any cognitive skill. It&rsquo;s not just that you can have an average IQ and still be a great chess player if you work hard enough &ndash; that&rsquo;s true, but it&rsquo;s not
  <i>
   just
  </i>
  that. It&rsquo;s that you can have an average IQ and still have
  <i>
   high levels of innate talent in chess
  </i>
  . It&rsquo;s not quite as likely as if you have a high IQ, but it&rsquo;s very much in the range of possibility. And
  <i>
   then
  </i>
  you add in the effects of working hard enough, and
  <i>
   then
  </i>
  you&rsquo;re getting somewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here is a table of professions by IQ, a couple of decades out of date but probably not too far off (cf. discussion

 <p>
  I don&rsquo;t know how better to demonstrate this idea of &ldquo;statistically solid, individually shaky&rdquo;. On a population level, we see that the average doctor is 30 IQ points higher than the average janitor, that college professors are overwhelmingly high-IQ, and we think yeah, this is about what we would hope for from a statistic measuring intelligence. But on an individual level, we see that below-average IQ people sometimes become scientists, professors, engineers, and almost anything else you could hope for.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   IV.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  I&rsquo;m kind of annoyed I have to write this post. After investing so much work debunking IQ denialists, I feel like this is really &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know &ndash; diluting the brand.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I actually think it&rsquo;s not as contradictory as it looks, that there&rsquo;s some common thread between my posts arguing that no, IQ isn&rsquo;t fake, and this one.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you really understand the idea of a statistical predictor &ndash; if you
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/11/03/what-developmental-milestones-are-you-missing/">
   have that gear in your brain
  </a>
  at a fundamental level &ndash; then social science isn&rsquo;t scary. You can read about IQ, or heredity, or stereotypes, or gender differences, or whatever, and you can say &ndash; ah, there&rsquo;s a slight tendency for one thing to correlate with another thing. Then you can go have dinner.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you don&rsquo;t get that, then the world is terrifying. Someone&rsquo;s said that IQ &ldquo;correlates with&rdquo; life outcomes? What the heck is &ldquo;correlate with&rdquo;? Did they say that only high-IQ people can be successful? That you&rsquo;re doomed if you don&rsquo;t get the right score on a test?
 </p>
 <p>
  And then you can either resist that with every breath you have &ndash; deny all the data, picket the labs where it&rsquo;s studied, make up silly theories about &ldquo;emotional intelligence&rdquo; and &ldquo;grit&rdquo; and what have you. Or you can surrender to the darkness, at least have the comfort of knowing that you accept the grim reality as it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  Imagine an American who somehow gets it into his head that the Communists are about to invade with overwhelming force. He might buy a bunch of guns, turn his house into a bunker, start agitating that Communist sympathizers be imprisoned to prevent them from betraying the country when the time came. Or he might hang a red flag from his house, wear a WELCOME COMMUNIST OVERLORDS tshirt, and start learning Russian. These seem like opposite responses, but they both come from the same fundamental misconception. A lot of the culture war &ndash; on both sides &ndash; seems like this. I don&rsquo;t know how to solve this except to try, again and again, to install the necessary gear and convince people that correlations are neither meaningless nor always exactly 1.0.
 </p>
 <p>
  So please: study the science of IQ. Use IQ to explain and predict social phenomena. Work on figuring out how to raise IQ. Assume that raising IQ will have far-ranging and powerful effects on a wide variety of social problems. Just don&rsquo;t expect it to predict a single person&rsquo;s individual achievement with any kind of reliability.

   I.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  A few years ago I had lunch with another psychiatrist-in-training and realized we had totally different experiences with psychotherapy.
 </p>
 <p>
  We both got the same types of cases. We were both practicing the same kinds of therapy. We were both in the same training program, studying under the same teachers. But our experiences were totally different. In particular, all her patients had dramatic emotional meltdowns, and all my patients gave calm and considered analyses of their problems, as if they were lecturing on a particularly boring episode from 19th-century Norwegian history.
 </p>
 <p>
  I&rsquo;m not bragging here. I
  <i>
   wish
  </i>
  I could get my patients to have dramatic emotional meltdowns. As per the textbooks, there should be a climactic moment where the patient identifies me with their father, then screams at me that I ruined their childhood, then breaks down crying and realizes that she loved her father all along, then ???, and then their depression is cured. I never got that. I tried, I even dropped some hints, like &ldquo;Maybe this reminds you of your father?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Maybe you feel like screaming at me right now?&rdquo;, but they never took the bait. So I figured the textbooks were misleading, or that this was some kind of super-advanced technique, or that this was among the approximately 100% of things that Freud just pulled out of his ass.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then I had lunch with my friend, and she was like &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so stressful when all of your patients identify you with their parents and break down crying, isn&rsquo;t it? Don&rsquo;t you wish you could just go
  <i>
   one day
  </i>
  without that happening?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  And later, my supervisor was reviewing one of my therapy sessions, and I was surprised to hear him comment that I &ldquo;seemed uncomfortable with dramatic expressions of emotion&rdquo;. I mean, I
  <i>
   am
  </i>
  uncomfortable with dramatic expressions of emotion. I was just surprised he noticed it. As a therapist, I&rsquo;m supposed to be quiet and encouraging and not show discomfort at anything, and I was trying to do that, and I&rsquo;d thought I was succeeding. But apparently I was unconsciously projecting some kind of &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like strong emotions, you&rsquo;d better avoid those&rdquo; field, and my patients were unconsciously complying.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wish I could say my supervisor&rsquo;s guidance fixed the problem and I learned to encourage emotional openness just as well as my colleague. But any improvement I made was incremental at best. My colleague is a bubbly extravert who gets very excited about everything; I worry that to match her results, I would have to somehow copy her entire personality.
 </p>
 <p>
  But all was not lost. I found myself doing well with overly emotional patients, the sort who had
  <i>
   too many
  </i>
  dramatic meltdowns to do therapy with anybody else. With me, they tended to give calm and considered analyses of their problems, as if they were lecturing on a particularly boring episode from 19th-century Norwegian history. Everyone assumed that meant I was good at dealing with difficult cases, and must have read a bunch of books about how to defuse crises. I did nothing to disabuse them of this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then a few days ago I stumbled across the Reddit thread
  <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/6e5avq/has_anyone_here_ever_been_to_an_lwssc_meetup_or/di81dq2/">
   Has Anyone Here Ever Been To An LW/SSC Meetup Or Otherwise Met A Rationalist IRL?
  </a>
  User dgerard wrote about meeting me in 2011, saying:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   His superpower is that he projects a Niceness Field, where people talking to him face to face want to be more polite and civil. The only person I&rsquo;ve met with a similar Niceness Field is Jimmy Wales from Wikipedia&hellip;when people are around [Jimmy] talking to him they feel a sort of urge to be civil and polite in discourse 🙂 I&rsquo;ve seen people visibly trying to be very precise and polite talking to him about stuff even when they&rsquo;re quite upset about whatever it is. Scott has this too. It&rsquo;s an interesting superpower to observe.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  I should admit nobody else has mentioned anything like this, and that narcissism biases me toward believing anyone who says I have a superpower. Still, it would explain a lot. And not necessarily in a good way. I&rsquo;ve always believed psychodynamic therapies are mostly ineffective, and cognitive-behavioral therapies very effective, because all my patients seem to defy the psychodynamic mode of having having weird but emotionally dramatic reactions to things in their past, but conform effortlessly to the cognitive-behavioral mode of being able to understand and rationally discuss their problems. And the more I examine this, the more I realize that my results are pretty atypical for psychiatrists. There&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m doing &ndash; totally by accident &ndash; to produce those results. This is worrying not just as a psychiatrist, but as someone who wants to know anything about other people at all.

 <p>
  New topic: paranoia and Williams Syndrome.
 </p>
 <p>
  Paranoia is a common symptom of various psychiatric disorders &ndash; most famously schizophrenia, but also paranoid personality disorder, delusional disorder, sometimes bipolar disorder. You can also get it from abusing certain drugs &ndash; marijuana, LSD, cocaine, and even prescription drugs like Adderall and Ritalin. The fun thing about paranoia is how gradual it is. Sure, if you abuse every single drug at once you&rsquo;ll think the CIA is after you with their mind-lasers. But if you just take a
  <i>
   little
  </i>
  more Adderall than you were supposed to, you&rsquo;ll be 1% paranoid. You&rsquo;ll have a very mild tendency to interpret ambiguous social signals just a little bit more negatively than usual. If a friend leaves without saying goodbye, and you would normally think &ldquo;Oh, I guess she had a train to catch&rdquo;, instead you think &ldquo;Hm, I wonder what she meant by that&rdquo;. There are a bunch of good stimulant abuse cases in the literature that present as &ldquo;patient&rsquo;s boss said she was unusually standoffish and wanted her to get psychiatric evaluation&rdquo;, show up in the office as &ldquo;well of course I&rsquo;m standoffish, everyone in my office excludes me from everything and is rude in a thousand little ways throughout the day&rdquo;, and end up as &ldquo;cut your Adderall dosage in half, please&rdquo;.
 </p>
 <p>
  (&ldquo;Why is that psychiatrist telling me to cut my Adderall in half? Does he think I&rsquo;m lying about having ADHD? Is he calling me a liar? These doctors have always treated me like garbage. I HAVE RIGHTS, YOU KNOW!&rdquo;)
 </p>
 <p>
  Williams Syndrome is much rarer &ndash; only about 1/10,000 people, and most of them die before reaching adulthood. It&rsquo;s marked by a sort of anti-paranoia; Williams patients are incapable of distrusting anyone. NPR has a good article,
  <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126224885">
   A Life Without Fear
  </a>
  , describing some of what they go through:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Kids and adults with Williams love people, and they are literally pathologically trusting. They have no social fear. Researchers theorize that this is probably because of a problem in their limbic system, the part of the brain that regulates emotion. There appears to be a disregulation in one of the chemicals (oxytocin) that signals when to trust and when to distrust. This means that it is essentially biologically impossible for [them] to distrust.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The results are less than heartwarming:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   As Isabelle got older, the negative side of her trusting nature began to play a larger role. A typical example happened a couple of years ago, when Jessica and her family were spending the day at the beach. Isabelle had been begging Jessica to go to Dairy Queen, and Jessica had been putting her off. Then Isabelle overheard a lady just down the beach.
  </p>
  <p>
   &ldquo;She was telling her kids, &lsquo;OK, let&rsquo;s go to the Dairy Queen,&rsquo; &rdquo; Jessica says. &ldquo;And so Isabelle went over and got into the lady&rsquo;s van, got in the back seat, buckled up and was waiting to be taken to Dairy Queen with that family.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p>
   Jessica had no idea what had happened to Isabelle and was frantically searching for her when the driver of the van approached her and explained that she had been starting her car when she looked up and saw Isabelle&rsquo;s face in the rearview mirror.
  </p>
  <p>
   The woman, Jessica says, was incredibly angry.
  </p>
  <p>
   &ldquo;She said, &lsquo;I am a stranger, you know!&rsquo; &rdquo; Jessica says. Essentially, the woman blamed Jessica for not keeping closer watch on her daughter &mdash; for neglecting to teach her the importance of not getting into a car with someone she didn&rsquo;t know. But the reality could not be more different. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;My friend, you have no idea,&rsquo; &rdquo; Jessica says.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fact, because of Isabelle, Jessica has had to rethink even the most basic elements of her day-to-day life. She can not take Isabelle to the dog park. She tries not to take Isabelle to the store. And when the doorbell rings, Jessica will leap over a coffee table to intercept her.
  </p>
  <p>
   It&rsquo;s not just Jessica and her family who must be vigilant. Every teacher at Isabelle&rsquo;s public school has been warned. Isabelle is not allowed to tell them that she loves them. Isabelle is not supposed to tell other schoolchildren that she loves them. And there are other restrictions.
  </p>
  <p>
   &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not allowed to go to the bathroom alone at her school, because there have been numerous instances of girls with Williams syndrome being molested at school when they were alone in the hallway,&rdquo; Jessica says. &ldquo;And these are like middle class type schools. So it&rsquo;s a very real problem. And, you know, I&rsquo;d rather her be overly safe than be on CNN.&rdquo;
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Some of the research on these kids is fascinating &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure I believe the study finding that they&rsquo;re
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20392417">
   incapable of racism
  </a>
  , but the one finding
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20005240">
   a deficit detecting anger in faces
  </a>
  seems pretty plausible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Williams Syndrome usually involves mental retardation, but not always. Some of these people have normal IQ. It doesn&rsquo;t really help. Threat-detection seems to be an automated process not totally susceptible to System II control. Maybe it&rsquo;s like face-blindness. Intelligence can help a face-blind person come up with some systems to reduce the impact of their condition, but in the end it&rsquo;s just not going to help that much.
 </p>
 <p>
  Psychiatric disorders are often at the extremes of natural variation in human traits. For every intellectually disabled person, there are a dozen who are just kind of dumb. For every autistic person, there are a dozen who are just sort of nerdy. And so on. We naturally think of some people as more trusting than others, but maybe that isn&rsquo;t the best frame. &ldquo;Trusting&rdquo; implies that we all receive the same information, and just choose how much risk we&rsquo;re willing to tolerate. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  A recent theme here has been
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/">
   the ways that our sense-data is underdetermined
  </a>
  . Each datum permits multiple possible explanations: this is true of visual and auditory perception, but also of the social world. A pretty girl laughs a little too long at a man&rsquo;s joke; is she trying to flirt with him, or just friendly? A boss calls her subordinate&rsquo;s work &ldquo;okay&rdquo; &ndash; did she mean to compliment him, or imply it was mediocre? A friend breaks off two appointments in a row, each time saying that something has come up &ndash; did something come up, or is he getting tired of the friendship? These are the sorts of questions everyone navigates all the time, usually with enough success that when autistic people screw them up, the rest of society nods sagely and says they need to learn to understand how to read context.
 </p>
 <p>
  But &ldquo;context&rdquo; means &ldquo;priors&rdquo;, and priors can differ from person to person. There&rsquo;s a lot of room for variation here before we get to the point where somebody will be so off-base that they end up excluded from society. Just as there&rsquo;s a spectrum from smart to dumb, or from introverted to extraverted, so there&rsquo;s a spectrum in people&rsquo;s tendencies to interpret ambiguous situations in a positive or negative way. There are people walking around who are just short of clinically paranoid, or just shy of Williams Syndrome levels of trust. And this isn&rsquo;t a value difference, it&rsquo;s a perceptual one. These people aren&rsquo;t bitter or risk-averse &ndash; or at least they don&rsquo;t

  that way. They just notice how everyone&rsquo;s hostile to them, all the time.

  Another change in topic: bubbles.
 </p>
 <p>
  I&rsquo;ve written before about how
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/">
   46% of Americans are young-earth creationists
  </a>
  , and how strongly that fails to square with my personal experience. I&rsquo;ve met young-earth creationists once or twice. But of my hundred closest friends/co-workers/acquaintances, I think zero percent of them fall in that category. I&rsquo;m not intentionally selecting friends on the basis of politics, religion, or anything else. It just seems to have happened. Something about my personality, location, social class, et cetera has completely isolated me from one particular half of the US population; I&rsquo;m living in a non-creationist bubble in the midst of a half-creationist country.
 </p>
 <p>
  What other bubbles do I live in? A quick look over my Facebook and some SSC survey results finds that my friends are about twenty times more likely to be transgender than the general population. There are about twice as many Asians but less than half as many African-Americans. Rates of depression, OCD, and autism are sky-high; rates of drug addiction and alcoholism are very low. Programmers are overrepresented at about ten times the Bay Area average.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn&rsquo;t intend any of these bubbles. For example, I&rsquo;ve never done any programming myself, I&rsquo;m not interested in it, and I try my best to avoid programmer-heavy places where I know all the conversations are going to be programming-related. Hasn&rsquo;t helped. And I&rsquo;m about as cisgender as can be, I have several Problematic opinions, and I still can&rsquo;t keep track of which gender all of my various friends are on a month-to-month basis. Part of it is probably class-, race-, and location-based. And I have some speculative theories about the rest &ndash; I think I have a pretty thing-oriented/systematizing thinking style, and so probably I get along better with other groups disproportionately made up of people whose thoughts work the
  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/11/the-link-between-autism-and-trans-identity/507509/">
   same
  </a>
  way &ndash; but I didn&rsquo;t understand any of this until a few years ago and there are still some parts that don&rsquo;t make sense. For now I just have to accept it as a given.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are other bubbles I understand much better. Most of my friends are pretty chill and conflict-averse. This is because I used to have scarier conflict-prone friends, and as soon as I got into conflicts with them, I broke off the friendship. I&rsquo;m not super-proud of this and it&rsquo;s probably one of those maladaptive coping styles you always hear about, and a lot of people have told me I&rsquo;m really extreme on this axis and need to be better at tolerating aggressive people &ndash; but whenever I try, I find it unpleasant and stop. I know some other people who seem to actively seek out abrasive types so they can get in fun fights with them. I don&rsquo;t understand these people at all &ndash; but whatever their thought processes, we have different bubbles.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of this goes double or triple for people I&rsquo;ve dated. I don&rsquo;t think of myself as clearly having a &ldquo;type&rdquo;, but people I date tend to turn out similar in dimensions I didn&rsquo;t expect when I first met them. I&rsquo;m going to be ambiguous here because it&rsquo;s a small enough sample that I don&rsquo;t want to give away people&rsquo;s private information, but it&rsquo;s true.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think about this a lot when I meet serial abuse victims.
 </p>
 <p>
  These people are a heartbreaking psychiatric cliche. Abused by their parents, abused by their high school boyfriend, abused by their first husband, abused by their second husband, abused by the guy they cheated on their first husband with, abused by the friend they tried to go to for help dealing with all the abuse. The classic (though super offensive)
  <a href="http://www.escapeabuse.com/?p=155">
   explanation
  </a>
  is that some people seek out abusers for some reason &ndash; maybe because they were abused as children and they&rsquo;ve internalized that as the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; model of a relationship.
 </p>
 <p>
  And maybe this is true for some people. I have a friend who admits it&rsquo;s true of her &ndash; her current strategy is to try to find someone in the sweet spot between &ldquo;jerkish/narcissistic enough to be interesting&rdquo; and &ldquo;jerkish/narcissistic enough to actually abuse her&rdquo;, and she&rsquo;s said so in so many words to people trying to matchmake. I guess all I can do is wish her luck.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for a lot of people, this sort of claim is just as offensively wrong as it sounds. I know people who have tried really hard to avoid abusers, who have gone to therapy and asked their therapist for independent verification that their new partner doesn&rsquo;t seem like the abusive type, who have pulled out all the stops &ndash; and who still end up with abusive new partners. These people are cursed through no fault of their own. All I can say is that whatever mysterious forces connect me to transgender pro-evolution programmers are connecting them to abusers. Something completely unintentional that they try their best to resist gives them a bubble of terrible people.
 </p>
 <p>
  I want to emphasize as hard as I can that I&rsquo;m not blaming them or saying there&rsquo;s anything they can do about their situation, and I have no doubt that despite my emphasis people are still going to accuse me of saying this, and I apologize if any of this sounds at all like anything in this direction. But
  <i>
   something
  </i>
  has to be happening here.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   IV.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes I write about discrimination, and people send me emails about their own experiences. Many sound like this real one (quoted here with permission) from a woman who studied computer science at MIT and now works in the tech industry:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In my life, I have never been catcalled, inappropriately hit on, body-shamed, unwantedly touched in a sexual way, discouraged from a male-dominated field, told I couldn&rsquo;t do something because it was a boy thing, or suffered from many other experiences that have traditionally served as examples as ways that women are less privileged. I have also never been shamed for not following gender norms (e.g. doing a bunch of math/science/CS stuff); instead I get encouraged and told that I&rsquo;m a role model. I&rsquo;ve never had problems going around wearing no make-up, a t-shirt, and cargo pants; but on the rare occasion that I do wear make-up / wear a dress, that&rsquo;s completely socially acceptable&hellip;Hopefully my thoughts/experiences are helpful for your future social justice based discussions.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Other times they sound like the opposite. I don&rsquo;t have anyone in this category who&rsquo;s given me permission to quote their email verbatim (consider ways this might not be a coincidence), but they&rsquo;re pretty much what you&rsquo;d expect &ndash; a litany of constantly being put down, discriminated against, harassed, et cetera, across multiple jobs, at multiple companies, to the point where they complain it&rsquo;s &ldquo;endemic&rdquo; (I guess I can quote one word) and that we need to reject a narrative of &ldquo;a few bad apples&rdquo; because really it&rsquo;s a problem with
  <i>
   all
  </i>
  men to one degree or another.
 </p>
 <p>
  These dueling categories of emails have always confused me. At the risk of being exactly the sort of creepy person the second set of writers complain about, I hunted down some of these people&rsquo;s Facebook profiles to see if one group was consistently more attractive than the other. They weren&rsquo;t. Nor is there any clear pattern in what industries or companies they work at, what position they&rsquo;re in, or anything else like that. There isn&rsquo;t even a consistent pattern in their politics. The woman I quote above mentions that she&rsquo;s a feminist who believes discrimination is a major problem &ndash; which has only made it extra confusing to her that she never experiences any of it personally.
 </p>
 <p>
  These people don&rsquo;t just show up in my inbox. Some of them write articles on
  <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/dear_prudence/2015/02/dear_prudence_feminists_are_upset_that_i_don_t_have_much_sexism_to_complain.html">

  , discussing not just how they&rsquo;ve never experienced discrimination, but how much anger and backlash they&rsquo;ve received when they try to explain this to everyone else. And all of them acknowledge that they know other people whose experiences seem to be the direct opposite.
 </p>
 <p>
  I used to think this was pretty much just luck of the draw &ndash; some people will end up with nice people at great companies, other people will end up with bigots at terrible companies. I no longer think this explains everybody. Take that New Yorker article, by a black person who grew up in the South and says she was never discriminated against even once. I assume in her childhood she met thousands of different white Southerners; that&rsquo;s a pretty big lucky streak for none of them at all to be racists, especially when you consider all the people who report daily or near-daily harassment. Likewise, when you study computer science in college and then work in half a dozen tech companies over the space of decades and never encounter one sexist, that&rsquo;s quite the record. Surely something else must be going on here.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   V.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  And I think this has to come back to the sorts of things discussed in Parts I, II, and III.
 </p>
 <p>
  People self-select into bubbles along all sorts of axes. Some of these bubbles are obvious and easy to explain, like rich people mostly meeting other rich people at the country club. Others are more mysterious, like how some non-programmer ends up with mostly programmer friends. Still others are horrible and completely outside comprehension, like someone who tries very hard to avoid abusers but ends up in multiple abusive relationships anyway. Even for two people living in the same country, city, and neighborhood, they can have a &ldquo;society&rdquo; made up of very different types of people.
 </p>
 <p>
  People vary widely on the way they perceive social interaction. A paranoid schizophrenic will view every interaction as hostile; a Williams Syndrome kid will view every interaction as friendly. In between, there will be a whole range of healthy people without any psychiatric disorder who tend toward one side or the other. Only the most blatant data can be interpreted absent the priors that these dispositions provide; everything else will only get processed through preexisting assumptions about how people tend to act. Since things like racism rarely take the form of someone going up to you and saying &ldquo;Hello, I am a racist and because of your skin color I plan to discriminate against you in the following ways&hellip;&rdquo;, they&rsquo;ll end up as ambiguous stimuli that everyone will interpret differently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, some people have personalities or styles of social interaction that unconsciously compel a certain response from their listeners. Call these &ldquo;niceness fields&rdquo; or &ldquo;meanness fields&rdquo; or whatever: some people are the sort who &ndash; if they became psychotherapists &ndash; would have patients who constantly suffered dramatic emotional meltdowns, and others&rsquo; patients would calmly discuss their problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  The old question goes: are people basically good or basically evil? Different philosophers give different answers. But so do different random people I know who aren&rsquo;t thinking philosophically at all. Some people describe a world of backstabbing Machiavellians, where everybody&rsquo;s a shallow social climber who will kick down anyone it takes to get to the top. Other people describe a world where everyone is basically on the same page, trying to be nice to everyone else but getting stuck in communication difficulties and honest disagreements over values.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think both groups are right. Some people experience worlds of basically-good people who treat them nicely. Other people experience worlds of awful hypocritical backstabbers. This can be true even if they live in the same area as each other, work the same job as each other, et cetera.
 </p>
 <p>
  And it&rsquo;s not just a basic good-evil axis. It can be about whether people are emotional/dramatic or calm/rational. It can be about whether people almost always discriminate or almost never do. It can be about whether they&rsquo;re honest or liars, shun outsiders or accept them, welcome criticism or reject it. Some people think elites are incompetent parasites; others that they&rsquo;re
  <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ub/competent_elites/">
   shockingly competent people
  </a>
  who mean well and have interesting personalities. Some people
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/11/silicon-valley-a-reality-check/">
   think Silicon Valley is
  </a>
  full of overpriced juicers, other people that it&rsquo;s full of structured-light engines. And the people who say all these things are usually accurately reporting their own experiences.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some people are vaguely aware of this in the form of &ldquo;privilege&rdquo;, which acknowledges different experiences at the cost of saying they have to line up exactly along special identity categories like race and gender. These certainly don&rsquo;t help, but it&rsquo;s not that simple &ndash; as proven by the article by that black Southerner who says she never once encountered discrimination. I&rsquo;ve seen completely incomprehensible claims about human nature by people of precisely the same race, sex, class, orientation, etc as myself, and I have no doubt they&rsquo;re trying to be truthful. The things that divide us are harder to see than we naively expect. Sometimes they&rsquo;re completely invisible.
 </p>
 <p>
  To return to a common theme:
  <i>
   nothing makes sense except in light of inter-individual variation
  </i>
  . Variation in people&rsquo;s
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/17/what-universal-human-experiences-are-you-missing-without-realizing-it/">

  . Variation in
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/11/03/what-developmental-milestones-are-you-missing/">
   level of abstract thought
  </a>
  . And to all of this I would add a variation in our experience of other people. Some of us are convinced, with reason, that humankind is basically good. Others start the day the same way Marcus Aurelius did:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they cannot tell good from evil.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Notice this distinction, this way in which geographic neighbors can live in different worlds, and other people&rsquo;s thoughts and behaviors get a little more comprehensible.

  talked about individual differences in whether people found others basically friendly or hostile. The
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/17/ssc-survey-2017-results/">
   SSC survey
  </a>
  included a sort of related question: &ldquo;Are people basically trustworthy?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  The exact phrasing asked respondents to rate other people from 1 (&ldquo;basically trustworthy&rdquo;) to 5 (&ldquo;basically untrustworthy&rdquo;). 4853 people answered. The average was 2.49 &ndash; so skewed a bit towards higher trust. The overall pattern looked like this:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <center>
  <img src="http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/trustworthy.png"/>
 </center>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Trust didn&rsquo;t differ by gender. Women averaged 2.56 and men 2.48, not a significant difference even with our fantastic sample size.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I couldn&rsquo;t detect it differing by race. Whites averaged 2.47 and nonwhites 2.59, which was nonsignificant despite decent sample size. Blacks were 2.81 and trended toward significance vs. whites, but the sample size was too small to be sure.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I couldn&rsquo;t detect it differing by religiousity. Committed theists (n = 506) had a trust level of 2.54, no more or less trusting than the average (and mostly atheist) SSC population.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I couldn&rsquo;t detect it differing by intelligence. There was no correlation between trust and either IQ or SAT score. There
  <i>
   was
  </i>
  a significant difference (p = 0.001) based on education level, all the way from PhDs at 2.35 to high school graduates only at 2.62.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were some decent-sized differences among different US states, with more urban and liberal states being more trusting. Among the states with decent sample size, California (n = 608) was 2.43, New York (n = 298) was 2.47, and Texas (n = 143) was 2.75; the California/Texas difference was significant at p = 0.001. I was only able to eyeball rather than actually significance-test the urban/liberal correlation, but it looked pretty strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were similar differences between countries. Germany (n = 192) at 2.35, the UK (n = 353) at 2.37, and Canada (n = 2.39) were all significantly more trusting than the US (n = 3124) at 2.53 &ndash; but obviously the effect wasn&rsquo;t too impressive. There were only two non-western countries with remotely usable sample sizes. Brazil (n = 28) was 2.89, and India (n = 27) was 2.81. The non-western/Anglosphere difference was significant even with the low sample size. The most trusting city in the world was Toronto (n = 60), at 2.23.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were so many professions, with such small sample sizes, that I wasn&rsquo;t really confident any of them were much more or less trusting than others. But for what it&rsquo;s worth, the number one least trusting profession, at 3.00, was mental health, and I am 100% not at all surprised. Otherwise there seemed to be a weak trend for nerdier and math-ier professions to be more trusting than others.
 </p>
 <p>
  By politics, the ranking looked like this:
 </p>
 <p>
  Social democratic: 2.38
  <br/>
  Liberal: 2.40
  <br/>
  Libertarian: 2.48
  <br/>
  Conservative: 2.67
  <br/>
  Communist: 2.80
  <br/>
  Neoreactionary: 2.97
  <br/>
  Alt-right: 2.97
 </p>
 <p>
  Looks like the same trend of conservative = less trusting. Harder to figure out what to think about left vs. liberal, given the social democrats in the lead vs. communists very far behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Effective altruists who had taken the GWWC Pledge were much more trusting &ndash; 2.19 &ndash; than any other natural group I could find in this survey, more trusting even than Torontoans. After some work, I managed to find an unnatural group that beat them. Polyamorous Less Wrong readers from California &ndash; my proxy for the real-life Bay Area rationalist community &ndash; had a trust score of 2.13.
 </p>
 <p>
  I had wondered if more trusting people would want less strict moderation, but the opposite was actually true &ndash; less trusting people wanted weaker moderation. Maybe this is mediated by conservativism &ndash; or maybe they just don&rsquo;t trust me to moderate!
 </p>
 <p>
  Autism, anxiety, OCD, and drug use all lowered trust; depression and bipolar disorder did not.
 </p>
 <p>
  People who put down &ldquo;Other&rdquo; in any category were always much less trusting than any of the options, almost as if they didn&rsquo;t trust people to accurately interpret the binned choices.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you want to look into this yourself, you can find the data publicly available
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/survey/Survey_Excel.xls">
   here
  </a>
  , but be warned &ndash; predictably, the people who agreed to let me make their data public were systematically more trusting (2.49) than the people who refused (2.70).

 <p>
  From
  <i>
   Boston Review
  </i>
  :
  <a href="https://donotlink.it/P5mj">
   Know Thy Futurist
  </a>
  . It&rsquo;s an attempt to classify and analyze various types of futurism, in much the same way that a Jack Chick tract could be described as &ldquo;an attempt to classify and analyze various types of religion&rdquo;.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have more disagreements with it than can fit in a blog post, but let&rsquo;s stick with the top five.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   First
  </b>
  , it purports to explain what we should think about the future, but never makes a real argument for it. It starts by suggesting there are two important axes on which futurists can differ: optimism vs. pessimism, and belief in a singularity. So you can end up with utopian singularitarians, dystopian singularitarians, utopian incrementalists, and dystopian incrementalists. We know the first three groups are wrong, because many of their members are &ldquo;young or middle-age white men&rdquo; who &ldquo;have never been oppressed&rdquo;. On the other hand, the last group contains &ldquo;majority women, gay men, and people of color&rdquo;. Therefore, the last group is right, there will be no singularity, and the future will be bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  You&rsquo;re going to protest that there has to be something more than that. Read the article. There really isn&rsquo;t. The author ignores the future almost completely, in favor of having very strong opinions on which futurist movements include the right or wrong sorts of people. AI risk researchers are &ldquo;majority men, although more women than in the previous group&rdquo;; techno-utopians are &ldquo;more women still&hellip;but in the end that does not denote progress&rdquo;. All singularitarians were &ldquo;sex-starved teenagers&rdquo; and they all &ldquo;wax eloquent about meritocracy over expensive wine&rdquo; in a &ldquo;super-rich bubble&rdquo;. The lovingly detailed descriptions everyone&rsquo;s social class, racial breakdown, gender ratio, what politics the author imagines they have, and what sexual insecurities she thinks produced their opinions.  contrasts markedly with a total lack of concern for any of their beliefs or opinions about the future, their justifications for their beliefs, or whether those justifications are true or false. Literally the only future-related thing we know about the article&rsquo;s third quadrant is that they may be involved in Bitcoin or something.
 </p>
 <p>
  The author never even begins to give any argument about why the future will be good or bad, or why a singularity might or might not happen. I&rsquo;m not sure she even realizes this is an option, or the sort of thing some people might think relevant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Second,
  </b>
  the article&rsquo;s section on singularitarianism never mentions anything about the Singularity and doesn&rsquo;t really seem to understand what the Singularity is. Its example of Singularity technologies are &ldquo;augmenting intelligence through robotics&rdquo;, &ldquo;better quality of life through medical breakthroughs&rdquo;, &ldquo;cryogenics&rdquo; (I assume it&rsquo;s confusing this with cryonics), &ldquo;medical strategies for living forever&rdquo;, and &ldquo;possibly even the blood of young people.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  None of these (except
  <i>
   maybe
  </i>
  the first) relate to the Singularity, which is defined as a point at which the rate of technological advance reaches near-infinity and it&rsquo;s impossible to predict what happens afterwards. The article seems to use &ldquo;singularitarianism&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;cool near-future technologies&rdquo;, which is kind of the opposite of its real meaning. This is a fatal error for an article proposing a system classifying all futurists as &ldquo;singularitarian&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;nonsingularitarian&rdquo;.
 </p>
 <p>
  It makes sense only in the context of the author having no interest in futurist movements at all, and indeed she later more-or-less admits that by &lsquo;singularitarian optimists&rsquo; she means &lsquo;rich white people she doesn&rsquo;t like&rsquo;. When discussing Elon Musk, whom some might call a pessimist based on his belief that the Singularity will destroy the world and doom humanity, she says that &ldquo;being an enormously rich and powerful entrepreneur, he probably belongs in the first [Singularity optimist] group&rdquo;.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Third
  </b>
  , the article wants to classify some technologies as inextricably associated with privilege, but it has a pretty weird conception of which ones they are. It gives five examples of technologies that it&rsquo;s possible to worry about without being a privileged white man, and every one of them is a different form of algorithmic bias. Really? That&rsquo;s the
  <i>
   only
  </i>
  future technology it&rsquo;s okay to care about? So much so that of five slots for potentially worrying technology, you filled all five with the same one?
 </p>
 <p>
  Likewise, when the author discusses bad &ldquo;singularity&rdquo; technologies that only white men could want, she includes &ldquo;better quality of life through medical breakthroughs&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m sure this just slipped in by accident. I&rsquo;m sure (pretty sure?) if we pointed her to someone with chronic pain who hasn&rsquo;t been able to leave the house in years and asked whether it might be good to have technology that could help this person, she would say yes. But it&rsquo;s a really interesting slip-up to make. I&rsquo;ve written hundreds of articles during my lifetime and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve
  <i>
   ever
  </i>
  mistakenly said that only privileged white men could care about not being sick.
 </p>
 <p>
  Again, this would make sense if the author doesn&rsquo;t really believe in futurology except as a way of sending the right class signals. Helping sick people improve their quality of life? Do gross male nerds from the outgroup support that or oppose that? Okay, sold. I&rsquo;m sure if her mental editor had caught it, she&rsquo;d have realized that she was
  <i>
   supposed
  </i>
  to support that kind of thing, but it would be a post-processing addition to her thought stream rather than a natural component of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Fourth
  </b>
  , the article presupposes a bitter conflict between the four quadrants, whereas actually people tend to be a lot more on the same side than she expects.
 </p>
 <p>

But one possible application for cryptocurrency is peer-to-peer microfinance via smart contracts &ndash; ie one of the most promising solutions to bias in big financial institutions.

  And her singularitarians are strategizing how to deal with far-future advanced AI algorithms, while her nonsingularitarians are strategizing how to deal with near-future primitive AI algorithms. These seem like&hellip;not entirely the opposite of each other? Imagine you were writing an article on the different kind of climatologists studying global warming. There&rsquo;s the kind who indulge in crazy sci-fi scenarios where entire cities flood and the Earth becomes uninhabitable. And then there&rsquo;s the kind dealing with important real-world problems like increased frequency of hurricanes and creeping desertification. Is this a reasonable distinction? Which kind should you be?

 </p>
 <p>
  Most people concerned about climate change are concerned about both those things. Maybe there&rsquo;s a little room for disagreement on the best way to balance long-term versus short-term goals &ndash; should we build seawalls to protect our cities today, or start a program of power plan retrofitting which will pay off in twenty years? But to try to turn these two positions into arch-enemies would be ridiculous and destructive. The scientists involved may have different research interests and skillsets, but not necessarily different opinions. Obviously we should have some people working on near-term problems and other people laying the groundwork to work on long-term problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  In real life, this is what futurists are doing too. The
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/06/notes-from-the-asilomar-conference-on-beneficial-ai/">
   Asilomar Conference on Beneficial AI
  </a>
  was organized by people whose main interest was far-future Singularity scenarios, but it included some of the top experts on algorithmic bias, gave the subject a lot of airtime, and ended up with all participants signing onto a
  <a href="https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/">
   set of principles
  </a>
  urging more work both on near-term AI problems like algorithmic bias and long-term AI problems like the development of superintelligence. Jed McCaleb, founder of Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox,

   donated $500,000

  of his profits to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, which deals with long-term concerns about the Singularity. In the real world, everyone from all four &ldquo;quadrants&rdquo; of futurist are either allies, or the same people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Again, I feel like this is the kind of error you could only make if you totally missed that futurism was a real subject, and you just wanted to make it into a morality play for your particular political opinions.

  , another quote from the article:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In the end my taxonomy (as amusing as I find it) doesn&rsquo;t really matter to the average person. For the average person there is no difference between the singularity as imagined by futurists in Q1 or Q2 and a world in which they are already consistently and secretly shunted to the &ldquo;loser&rdquo; side of each automated decision.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  I already posited that the author doesn&rsquo;t understand &ldquo;Singularity&rdquo;, but this is something beyond that. This is horrifying. There will be no difference for the average person between a (positive or negative) post-singularity world and the world now?
  <i>
   What?
  </i>
 </p>
 <p>
  Listen up, average person. If there&rsquo;s a negative singularity you will notice. Because you will be very, very dead. So will all the rest of us, rich and poor, old and young, black and white.
 </p>
 <p>
  And if there&rsquo;s a positive singularity, you will also notice. I would promise you infinite wealth, but that sort of thing kind of loses its meaning in a post-scarcity society. I would promise you immortality, but who knows if we&rsquo;ll even have individual consciousnesses at that point? I would promise you bread and roses, but they would be made of hyperintelligent super-wheat and fractal eleven-dimensional time blossoms.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don&rsquo;t care if you think this vision is stupid. We&rsquo;re not arguing about whether this vision is stupid. We&rsquo;re arguing about whether, if this vision were 100% true, it would make a difference in the life of the average person. The
  <i>
   Boston Review
  </i>
  is saying it wouldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m sitting here with my mouth gaping open so hard I&rsquo;m worried about permanent jaw damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Singularity that doesn&rsquo;t make a difference in the life of the average person isn&rsquo;t a Singularity worth the bits it&rsquo;s programmed on. And the triumphs of science have always been triumphs for common people, whether it was the Green Revolution saving hundreds of millions of lives in the Third World, or the advent of antiparasitic drugs that are wiping malaria from Africa. When Ray Kurzweil says that the future is exponential, he&rsquo;s not just talking about the number of transistors per square inch, he&rsquo;s talking about this (and note the green line representing &ldquo;percent of people not living in extreme poverty&rdquo;):

 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  This is what everyone in whatever school or quadrant of futurism you care to name is thinking about. This is the only true thing. Drones, Bitcoin, Uber, superintelligence, whatever, these are part of it, but they&rsquo;re not the goal in itself. We are going to fight our hardest to end poverty, disease, death, and suffering, and we&rsquo;re going to do it in spite of petty
  <i>
   Boston Review
  </i>
  articles telling us we should stop doing it so we can focus on hating each other for stupid reasons.
 </p>
 <p>
  So here&rsquo;s
  <i>
   my
  </i>
  division of futurists into two groups: shining examples, and terrible warnings. And the patron saint of the latter category is Samuel Madden.
 </p>
 <p>
  Madden was an Anglican clergyman in 18th-century Ireland, and maybe the first futurist. In 1733, he published
  <i>
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_of_the_Twentieth_Century">
    Memoirs of the Twentieth Century
   </a>
  </i>
  , a novel about people in 1999 sending letters back through time to tell their 18th-century predecessors what the future would hold.
 </p>
 <p>
  How did the prognosticators of 1733 imagine the future? Was it utopian? Decadent? Miserable? Beautiful? Incomprehensible?
 </p>
 <p>
  Actually, it was none of those things. It was exactly like 1733 in every way, and the future people were just writing back to remind everyone how much Catholics sucked.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am serious about this. Book-World-1999 had no technological advances over 1733. The political situation was more or less the same, although the Wikipedia review mentions that &ldquo;Tatars&rdquo; had taken Constantinople at some point. The important thing, the thing that they invented time travel to tell the past, was that Catholics were still bad. Really, really bad. The people of 1733 really needed to know just how amazingly bad Catholics were and would continue to be.
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem here isn&rsquo;t just that Catholics aren&rsquo;t really that bad. I feel like even if Catholics were exactly as bad as Samuel Madden thought, there would still be an unforgivable pettiness here. If we could show Samuel Madden the real future of his world, I hope he would be awed and horrified beyond words. The hope and heartbreak of the French Revolution, the lightning-fast transformations of industrialization, the slow march of atheism through previously Christian Europe, the otherworldly horror of the atom bomb, the glory of the moon landing, and then a 1999 poised on the edge between a Fukuyaman end of history and collapse into environmental disaster and dystopia &ndash; nobody could write a book as grand as this, but surely one could win eternal renown just by making the feeblest attempt. And instead, we get &ldquo;EVERYTHING THE SAME; ALSO, HATE CATHOLICS&rdquo;. The only emotion I can muster is a sort of profound disgust.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I can&rsquo;t help but feel the same disgust when I read &ldquo;Know Thy Futurist&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know whether the future will be better or worse than the past, but I feel pretty sure it will be
  <i>
   grander
  </i>
  . Either we will perish in nuclear apocalypse or manage to avert nuclear apocalypse; either one will be history&rsquo;s greatest story. Either we will discover intelligent alien life or find ourselves alone in the universe; either way would be terrifying. Either we will suppress AI research with a ferocity that puts the Inquisition to shame, or we will turn into gods creating life in our own image; either way the future will be not quite human. And faced with all of the immensity and danger of the coming age, the best the
  <i>
   Boston Review
  </i>
  can pull off is &ldquo;HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE SPECULATING ABOUT THIS MIGHT BE IN YOUR (((OUTGROUP)))?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  There&rsquo;s a Deeply Wise Saying that all science/prediction/philosophy/theology/whatever will inevitably reflect the parochial conditions of the writer&rsquo;s own time. Maybe so. But I feel like it doesn&rsquo;t have to be
  <i>
   quite
  </i>
  as parochial as Samuel Madden. If the people of 1733 had thought about things really hard, tried to transcend the feuds of their local time and place, might they have predicted the Industrial Revolution? Might they have been able to accelerate it, delay it, send it along a different track that ameliorated some of the displacement and poverty it caused in reality? I don&rsquo;t know. But it would have been a pretty amazing attempt. What would it look like to try to do something like that today? Is &ldquo;Know Thy Futurist&rdquo; making it more or less likely that will happen?
 </p>
 <p>
  In the grand scheme of things, it&rsquo;s probably dumb for me to be so angry about this one article. I guess what bothers me is that it&rsquo;s
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  just one article. Probably a
  <i>
   majority
  </i>
  of the stuff I see written evaluating the future, or technology, or
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/11/silicon-valley-a-reality-check/">
   Silicon Valley
  </a>
  these days seems to take basically this perspective. I was really mad at
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/01/g-k-chesterton-on-ai-risk/">
   Maciej Ceglowski
  </a>
  a few months ago because his anti-singularity screed was about half this kind of thing, but by this point 50%-real-argument is looking pretty good. More and more people are dropping the 50%-real-argument veneer and just admitting that stereotypes and ad hominems are the way they want to conduct everything. Do we really need to turn our hopes and dreams about the world to come into yet
  <i>
   another
  </i>
  domain where white people accuse other white people of whiteness and are accused of whiteness in turn until everyone hates each other and anything good and real gets buried in an endless heap of bullshit and 140-character brutal owns?
 </p>
 <p>
  I wish ignoring this kind of thing was an option, but
  <i>
   this is how our culture relates to things now
  </i>
  . It seems important to mention that, to have it out in the open, so that people who turn out their noses at responding to this kind of thing don&rsquo;t wake up one morning and find themselves
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/15/my-id-on-defensiveness/">
   boxed in
  </a>
  . And if you&rsquo;ve got to call out crappy non-reasoning sometime, then meh, this article seems as good an example as any.
 </p>
 <p>
  If we get very lucky, there will actually be a future. Some of the people in it will probably read the stuff we write. They&rsquo;ll judge us. I assume most of that judgment will involve laughing hysterically. But we can at least aim for laughter that&rsquo;s good-natured instead of scornful.
  <i>
   Sub specie aeternatis
  </i>
  , how much of what we do today is going to look to them the way Samuel Madden does to us?

  Pop science likes to dub dopamine &ldquo;the reward chemical&rdquo; and serotonin &ldquo;the happiness chemical&rdquo;. God only knows what norepinephrine is, but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s cutesy.
 </p>
 <p>
  In real life, all of this is much more complicated. Dopamine
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/">
   might be
  </a>
  &ldquo;the surprisal in a hierarchical predictive model chemical&rdquo;, but even that can&rsquo;t be more than a gross oversimplification. As for serotonin, people have studied it for seventy years and the best they can come up with is &ldquo;uh, something to do with stress&rdquo;.

   Serotonin and brain function: a tale of two receptors
  </a>
  by Robin Carhart-Harris and David Nutt tries to cut through the mystery. Both authors are suitably important to attempt such an undertaking. Carhart-Harris is a neuropsychopharmacologist and one of the top psychedelic researchers in the world. Nutt was previously the British drug czar but missed the memo saying drug czars were actually supposed to be
  <i>
   against
  </i>
  drugs; after using his position to tell everyone drugs were pretty great, he was summarily fired. Now he&rsquo;s another neuropsychopharmacology professor, though with cool side projects like
  <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/hangover-free-alcohol-david-nutt-alcosynth-nhs-postive-effects-benzodiazepine-guy-bentley-a7324076.html">
   inventing magical side-effect-free alcohol
  </a>
  . These are good people.
 </p>
 <p>
  And they have a good theory. One stumbling block in past attempts to understand serotonin was the brain&rsquo;s dozen or so different types serotonin receptors, all of which seem to do kind of different things. Carhart-Harris and Nutt (subsequently: CH&amp;N) focus on two of these which show up again and again in psychiatry: 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A. Past studies had always shown these two receptors having kind of opposite effects, which confused things pretty thoroughly: why would you want a chemical that does two opposite things?
 </p>
 <p>
  5-HT1A is the most common serotonin receptor in the brain. When SSRI antidepressants like Prozac, Zoloft and Celexa increase serotonin, this is the receptor most of that serotonin goes to. Some other antidepressants and antianxiety medications like BuSpar, Viibryd and Trintellix just stimulate this receptor directly. So it looks like this receptor does
  <i>
   something like
  </i>
  &ldquo;reduce depression and anxiety&rdquo;. But this falls afoul of a version of
  <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Drug-heuristics">
   Algernon&rsquo;s Law
  </a>
  : there shouldn&rsquo;t be any switch in the brain which is 100% good or 100% bad. Why have a receptor for treating depression and anxiety, rather than just always keep the receptor at maximum so you&rsquo;re never depressed or anxious?
 </p>
 <p>
  5-HT2A is another pretty common receptor. Most new antipsychotics like Seroquel and Abilify block this receptor. And most psychedelic drugs like LSD and magic mushrooms stimulate it really hard. Since psychedelics make you kind of crazy, and antipsychotics make you stop being crazy, 5-HT2A must have something to do with psychosis. Of course, this is another Algernon&rsquo;s Law violation: why is there a receptor just to make you psychotic?
 </p>
 <p>
  1A and 2A seem to &ldquo;fight&rdquo; each other. The more you activate 1A, the quieter 2A becomes &ndash; this is why people on SSRIs get less effect from psychedelics. And all the drugs that block 2A are also decent antidepressants &ndash; this is why people recommend Seroquel for depression even though it&rsquo;s an antipsychotic &ndash; and this seems to work because blocking 2A increases 1A.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, there also seems to be some deeper unity. 1A makes you less depressed. 2A &ndash; well, we keep hearing all these studies, some of them from Dr. Carhart-Harris himself, showing that magic mushrooms treat depression really well. Not just as a once daily medication, but in the sense that one trip on mushrooms can make you long-term &ndash; maybe permanently &ndash; less depressed. This is pretty weird. Blocking 2A makes you less depressed? But stimulating 2A also makes you less depressed, in a different and more permanent way? What&rsquo;s going on?
 </p>
 <p>
  CH&amp;N argue: both 1A and 2A promote coping with stress. 1A promotes &ldquo;passive coping&rdquo;. 2A promotes &ldquo;active coping&rdquo;.
 </p>
 <p>
  Passive coping is basically being stoic, having a stiff upper lip, and waiting it out. Imagine you&rsquo;re at some kind of terrible job and your boss is bullying you all the time and you can&rsquo;t stand it and you get depressed and anxious. Your psychiatrist gives you an SSRI (or BuSpar, or Viibryd, or some other 1A stimulator) and now, you
  <i>
   can
  </i>
  stand it. Your boss is still just as mean. Your life is still just as bad. But you sort of shrug, think &ldquo;what can I do?&rdquo; and get back to work. This isn&rsquo;t the most inspiring story, but it&rsquo;s better than alternatives like &ldquo;being a wreck&rdquo; or &ldquo;snapping and attacking your boss&rdquo;. Did I mention that 1A is known to decrease impulsivity and aggression? Makes sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Active coping is&hellip;uh&hellip;sort of unclear from the paper. It sounds like it should mean working to solve the problem &ndash; quitting your job, finding a way to stand up for yourself. Heck, even snapping and attacking your boss would tie in with the psychosis angle. This is&hellip;not exactly where CH&amp;N go, as far as I can tell. Active coping is like&hellip;an LSD trip? It&rsquo;s some kind of grabbing the brain and shaking it, in the hopes that maybe when it settles it will be in a state that&rsquo;s better able to deal with whatever&rsquo;s going on. This sort of makes sense, insofar as big steps like quitting your job might require a lot of mental shake-up to consider. It seems to have something to do with a process of increased plasticity, becoming bolder to avoid getting trapped at local minima, and increasing the information-theoretic entropy of brain states. This definitely sounds like the sort of thing that can cause psychosis, and
  <i>
   maybe
  </i>
  it sounds like the sort of thing that might help?
 </p>
 <p>
  MDMA, a strong 2A agonist, is currently in Phase III trials as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. It looks
  <i>
   really
  </i>
  promising. Under CH&amp;N&rsquo;s theory, this makes a lot of sense. If you have trauma, your thoughts get stuck in some pattern which is useful for dealing with or avoiding the traumatic situation &ndash; for example, an abused child learns to be suspicious and afraid of everybody. People do therapy for years trying to cast off these thought patterns; they know they&rsquo;re no longer adaptive, but they just can&rsquo;t get rid of them. On MDMA &ndash; and especially in MDMA-assisted therapy &ndash; people find it easy; the usual metaphor is calcified thought patterns suddenly become fluid and re-writable. Is this the sort of &ldquo;increased plasticity&rdquo; that CH&amp;N describe?
 </p>
 <p>
  This theory gives an explanation of how 1A and 2A can have such a complex &ndash; and sometimes antagonistic &ndash; relationship. When a person undergoes adversity, their brain releases serotonin, which starts by hitting the 1A receptors. They bear it stoically and hopefully soldier through. But if the adversity gets really bad and the serotonin release passes some threshold, it starts hitting the 2A receptors instead. Now their brain realizes things are pretty bad, it&rsquo;s got to try high-variance strategies, and so it increases its randomness in the hope of stumbling across a way-out-there solution to the problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  (not super-clear what problem
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/28/why-were-early-psychedelicists-so-weird/">
   John Lilly thought he was solving
  </a>
  by accusing space aliens of orchestrating a massive conspiracy to manipuate the world&rsquo;s coincidences, but it&rsquo;s a pretty safe bet the 2A receptor was involved somehow.)
 </p>
 <p>
  I find the whole thing pretty plausible. But as written, it doesn&rsquo;t entirely answer the Algernon&rsquo;s Law questions. Why doesn&rsquo;t everyone just have 1A and 2A functions set to max all the time? What&rsquo;s the tradeoff?
 </p>
 <p>
  There are some obvious possibilities. Too much 2A stimulation makes you psychotic. This puts the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics like Seroquel in a new light: they&rsquo;re saying something like &ldquo;keep your thoughts very careful and low-risk, this isn&rsquo;t a good time to be deviating from normal patterns&rdquo;. And so maybe someone who otherwise would have believed the space aliens were putting a transmitter in his teeth will decide
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  to think that. Is there a shade of Bayesian brain theory here? Is the phrase we&rsquo;re looking for &ldquo;strength of priors&rdquo;? I don&rsquo;t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  Likewise obvious: if 1A promotes stoic coping, then too much of it prevents you from actively making your life better. One can imagine how this would be more relevant in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness than today. Back then stressors could have been some specific person whose skull you could bash in with a rock. Nowadays they tend to be things like corporations, national governments, and groups of people with terrible politics on Twitter; attempted skull-bashing, as satisfying as it might feel, is highly disrecommended.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don&rsquo;t know if these stories are true. They don&rsquo;t really explain why 1A and 2A function seem inversely related. Is this just a wiring issue? Or is there some fundamental reason why ability to passively cope can&rsquo;t coexist with creative outside-the-box problem-solving? Maybe the coping involves some sort of mental resolution not to let all the stress change the brain at all, and the problem-solving involves the brain becoming superplastic and really easily influenced by external events. But it&rsquo;s not really clear why either of those things should be necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, we should remember that although CH&amp;N&rsquo;s theory explains a lot, we&rsquo;re reading the case they&rsquo;re presenting, and there&rsquo;s a lot they leave out. Some might complain that calling 2A the &ldquo;active coping receptor&rdquo; is as reductionistic as the whole &ldquo;dopamine is the reward chemical&rdquo; thing &ndash; 2A is also involved in obesity, sexual dysfunction, some forms of insomnia, possibly chronic fatigue syndrome, platelet clumping, et cetera. All of these psychedelics do opposite things acutely and chronically &ndash; something CH&amp;N acknowledge &ndash; so you have to be really careful with time course in order to figure out whether your acid trip is treating depression due to acutely increased 2A stimulation or chronically decreased number of 2A receptors. Both Carhart-Harris and Nutt have spent big parts of their careers advocating more use of psychedelics, so them coming up with a theory of why psychedelics are really good is both reasonable and suspicious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, this is as good a theory of serotonin function as anything else I&rsquo;ve seen, and it will be exciting to see if it suggests any avenues for experimental research to confirm or refute it.
